## Plotting the Tooth Growth dataset

The response is the length of odontoblasts (cells responsible for tooth growth) in 60 guinea pigs. Each animal received one of three dose levels of vitamin C (0.5, 1, and 2 mg/day) by one of two delivery methods, orange juice or ascorbic acid (a form of vitamin C and coded as VC).

## Plot

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
options(warn=-1)
library(plotly)
library(ggplot2)
library(colorspace)
library(graphics)
library(htmlwidgets)
library(leaflet)
p <- ggplot(data = ToothGrowth, aes(x = dose, y = len)) +
  geom_point(aes(x = dose, y = len)) +  
  geom_smooth(aes(colour = supp, fill = supp)) + facet_wrap(~ supp)
ggplotly(p)
```
